## Lab 1 Fundamentals
Justin Wang

## General Overview
The project was to give a general introduction into LEDs and how to manipulate the led blink pattern.
 
## Files

| # | File Name | Description |
| :-: | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | [Blink.ino](./Blink.ino) | Code used to make LED blick |
| 2 | [Potentiometer.ino](./Potentiometer.ino) | Code used to make LED blink faster depending on how much you turn up or down the potentiometer |
| 3 | [RGB.ino](./RGB.ino) | Code used to make RGB LED to cycle through all colors |

## Instructions 

Download the files included and compile and run for results. No dependencies needed.

## ðŸ§  Reflection Questions

1. What happens if you reduce the delay to 10ms?
    - If you reduce the delay to 10ms, that would cause the LED to flicker extremely fast. Look at section 3 for that example of the 10ms delay/
2. Why do we use resistors with LEDs?
    - We use resistors with LEDS because we do not want to cause the LED to burn out because of the high voltages.
3. What challenges would arise using an RGB LED as a signal light?
    - Some challenges that would arise from using an RGB LED as a signal light would be the LED burning out quicker since its all housed within a close vicinity. 
4. How would you add a pushbutton to toggle blinking on/off?
    - you could implement a constant global variable such as a boolean to turn the status on/off.
