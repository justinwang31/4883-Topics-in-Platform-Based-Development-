# ðŸ§  Reflection Questions

1. What happens if you reduce the delay to 10ms?
    - If you reduce the delay to 10ms, that would cause the LED to flicker extremely fast. Look at section 3 for that example of the 10ms delay/
2. Why do we use resistors with LEDs?
    - We use resistors with LEDS because we do not want to cause the LED to burn out because of the high voltages.
3. What challenges would arise using an RGB LED as a signal light?
    - Some challenges that would arise from using an RGB LED as a signal light would be the LED burning out quicker since its all housed within a close vicinity. 
4. How would you add a pushbutton to toggle blinking on/off?
    - you could implement a constant global variable such as a boolean to turn the status on/off.
