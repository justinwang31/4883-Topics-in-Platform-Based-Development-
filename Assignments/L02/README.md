## Soldering a Sonic Led Level Meter

  **Section 1: The Solder**
  
  Not my prettiest work but all contacts are functional.

  General Overview:

  I tried at first going with the example that was provided but I soon realized that it was a bit cluttered so I ended up going with a design that I felt was much more suitable. The general concepts and parts are still similar to what was originally shown. Of course, I have the code included in this section to get ultra sonic level meter. Included in here, I have different photo angles of my soldering and the overall breadboard as well as a short video demonstration of me moving back and the led indicators going up the farther I am from the device.

**Section 3: The Device in Action**

I have instructed it so that the farther I am from the device, the more the meter will rise / more leds will light up. Of course, Vice versa applies as well.
