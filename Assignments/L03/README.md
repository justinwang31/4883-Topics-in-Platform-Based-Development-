## Lab Game Projects

  **Section 1: General Overview**

The  game project that I decided to work on is a simon says game. It would first flash in a random order and the player would need to correctly repeat the pattern that was presented. I then 3D printed an enclosure so that the parts would stay contained as well as use flat jumpers that way, the cables are not in the way of the buttons. The enclosure has openings so that a power cable can be connected to the arduino and all for it to be connected to the pc. Due to  space constraints and insight failure on my behalf, I was not able to put in a OLED screen (otherwise the screen would crack from trying to shut the enclosure.) The workwaround I have is that by utilizing the serial monitor in the arudino IDE, I am able to output what round the player is at and if they fail the round, it would tell people what round they ended on. In the future, it would be fairly easy to implement a screen feature. I think another thing that would've helped out for this project would be if I had more experience using 3D modeling software as majority of my 3D prints were found online.
